We give the coefficients from triangle (1,1,2) box (1,1,1,2) and pentagon (1,1,1,1,2) to all scalar basis, and the solution of our parameters in the media steps.

There are 7 basis in triangle case, 15 basis in box case and 31 basis in pentagon case.

we list all the coefficients in the mathematica notebook.

Since the expression of the coefficients are too long in pentagon's case, we seperate them in several notebook.
